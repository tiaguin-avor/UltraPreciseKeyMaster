## Overview

**UltraPreciseKeyMaster** is a high-precision AutoHotkey script designed for ultra-accurate keypress simulation. It uses advanced timing calibration, statistical filtering, and spinlock sleeping to achieve reliable, low-latency key holds, particularly useful for tasks that demand consistent input timing such as gaming, automation, or testing.

## Features

- 🔄 **Realtime Process Priority** – Ensures the script runs with maximum CPU priority.
- 🧠 **Advanced Calibration System** – Measures system overhead using statistical filtering and outlier rejection.
- 🛠 **Dynamic Timing Adjustment** – Adjusts key hold duration based on real-world timing deviations.
- 🧪 **Timing Diagnostics** – Visual feedback for timing accuracy and adjustments.
- 🔧 **Customizable Hold Time** – Modify key hold duration live via hotkeys or precise input.
- 🔁 **Auto Recalibration** – Periodically recalibrates to maintain accuracy during long runtimes.
- ⚡ **Spinlock Precision Sleep** – Avoids delays from standard sleep methods with tight timing loops.

## Default Hotkeys

| Hotkey           | Description                              |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `F1`             | Toggle the script on/off                 |
| `e`              | Press & hold the key precisely           |
| `Ctrl + ↑ / ↓`   | Increase/decrease hold time by 0.01 ms   |
| `Ctrl + Shift + ↑ / ↓` | Adjust hold time by 0.1 ms         |
| `Ctrl + E`       | Input a specific hold time (in ms)       |
| `Alt + T`        | Toggle timing diagnostics on/off         |
| `Ctrl + Esc`     | Exit and clean up the script             |

> **Note:** The key being simulated by default is `e`. You can change this in the `CustomE` section.

## How It Works

- **Calibration:** On startup and at regular intervals, the script measures how long it takes to send a keystroke and adjusts timing based on system overhead.
- **Spinlock Sleep:** Instead of using `Sleep`, which is coarse, it uses high-frequency performance counters to wait with sub-millisecond accuracy.
- **Diagnostics:** When enabled, timing differences are displayed in real-time so you can see how accurately the script is performing.

## Installation

1. Install [AutoHotkey v1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
2. Save the script as `UltraPreciseKeyMaster.ahk`.
3. Run the script by double-clicking it or placing it in your startup folder for automatic launch.
4. Press `F1` to activate.

## Customization

To change the key being simulated (default: `e`), edit these lines:

```ahk
Hotkey, *e, CustomE, On
Hotkey, *e Up, CustomE_Up, On
